## Foreword

For humans in general it is easier to write in markdown:)
For nushell users often properly formatted `.nu` script can be a convenient and powerful way for communication, and on the huge need we can always use something like `numd`.
For machines it will be much easier to write in data specific formats.
It is possible to convert all data between each other.
So here is the description.

### My principles

#### Information exchange

I learned from Dmitriy Shamenkov, that communication has phisiological roots. And it's appropriate to approximate the rules of phisiological proceses on the communication between pepole.

It's better to be precise in communication. I disclose even the not most favorable details about me to help create a more precise picture about me.

#### Any educational process includes trial an error

We just learn about the world by living, constantly making assumptions of the current situation and predictions. And in each moment of time we recieve feedback from the environment.

Good teacher and upbringing might influence the educational process, though even the exceptional ones can't guarantee education that will prevent bad choices in all the fields of life.
